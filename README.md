# Practicing Array Methods
This mini-project is to practice array methods so that I can can become more comfortable using them in my future projects. 

## Update 31-12-2021

Managed to apply array methods to an API (Rick and Morty) to fetch and display data. I will expand on this to create a Rick and Morty search engine in a seperate repo. 

Additionally, I learned how to extract and process data from an API with multiple pages, as well as display data from API dynamically on the DOM.
